The world of software engineering has grown rapidly in recent years. The constant growth has allowed for nontechies to consider and pursue a change in career. In recent years, the rise of coding bootcamps and various other avenues has made the tech industry easier to enter. This and other reasons has lead me to consider a tech career.

I have always believed in working hard to achieve success. Although, that notion doesn't always lead to financial and intellectual fullfillment. I have decided to use a more target approach towards the tech industry. For example, the tech industry allows me to utilize my creative and logistic mind to release my inner self. I'm liberated from static thinking and limitations. I can determine my future with a wide-selection of career path from simply learning an excelling at coding. Lastly, most major cities provides hub for techies to explore, so there is a long list of options for relocating. These factors have made coding an excellent choice for me.
