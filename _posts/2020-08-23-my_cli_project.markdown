The week of this project was definetely a learning lesson. I knew the project was coming, but I didn't know it would require more patience and focus than the labs. I spent a few days thinking about exactly what I would write about. I wonder should I use an API or scrape with nokogiri. I was completely lost. After a few days. I started to realize that how you code is a skill to complete a real world task. I knew I had all of the lessons in my bag, so I had tools to complete the project. 

I utilized my skills with hashes and object oriented to finish my project. I was able to use the object relationship and metaprgramming to successful complete my assignment. I feel confident moving forward that I can accomplish anything with the skills that I've obtain and that I'm learning.
